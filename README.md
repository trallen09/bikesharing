# NYC Citibike Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
This analysis was done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
It was important to determine the time usages for the bike share which includes:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:

### Summary

- Starting and ending locations tend to overlap
